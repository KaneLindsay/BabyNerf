# NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis

Full PyTorch implementation (with heirarchical volume sampling) of the paper 'NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis' (2019) by Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng.
Extended from the '100 lines of code' implementation by Maxime Vandegar, available online at https://github.com/MaximeVandegar/Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code.git.
